# Tab Visualizer

An Edge / Chrome extension that visualizes tab relationships and browsing history in an interactive tree view. See how your tabs are connected when opened via hyperlinks or from other tabs.

Current status - usable, still a few bugs, and still figuring out usefulness. Most of base functionality exists. Still dont have ability to close tabs (only view them and go-to tab when clicked). I think it has potential but might be obsolete with agentic AI replacing browsing.

## Features

- **Multiple View Modes**: Tree view (hierarchical relationships), Sequential view (chronological timeline), and Canvas view (2D spatial organization with infinite scrolling)
- **Tab Relationship Tracking**: Automatically tracks parent-child relationships - when tabs are opened via hyperlink from another tab
- **Drag-to-Parent**: In Canvas view, drag a tab onto another to make it a child (with visual feedback). 
   - Can use multi-select to do this in tree view.
- **Tab Comments**: Add notes to any tab via context menu (üí¨ indicator shows tabs with comments)
- **Infinite 2D Canvas**: Drag and drop tabs anywhere with automatic push-away of overlapping elements
- **Smart Grouping**: Auto-group tabs by domain or create custom groups with visual organization
- **Children Popup**: Click the dot (‚óè) on any parent tab to see all children tabs
- **Search & Filter**: Quickly find tabs by title or URL with live filtering
- **Data Export**: Export your tab history as JSON with full canvas state
- **Persistent Storage**: Tab data, positions, groups, and comments survive browser restarts
- **Real-time Updates**: Visualization updates automatically as you browse

## How It Works

### Background Service Worker (background.js)

The service worker runs in the background and listens for tab events:

- **chrome.tabs.onCreated**: Captures when new tabs are created and stores the parent tab ID (`openerTabId`)
- **chrome.tabs.onUpdated**: Updates tab titles and URLs as pages load
- **chrome.tabs.onRemoved**: Marks tabs as inactive when closed (preserves history)

All data is stored in `chrome.storage.local` which persists across browser sessions.

### Data Structure

Each tab is stored with the following information:

```javascript
{
  id: number,          // Unique tab ID
  title: string,       // Page title
  url: string,         // Page URL
  parentId: number,    // ID of parent tab (or null for root tabs)
  timestamp: number,   // When the tab was created
  active: boolean      // Whether tab is currently open
}
```

### Visualization (view.html/css/js)

The visualization:
1. Loads tab data from `chrome.storage.local`
2. Builds a tree structure by linking children to parents
3. Renders the tree with proper indentation and styling
4. Updates automatically when storage changes

## Features in Detail

### Search & Filter

Type in the search box to filter tabs by title or URL. The tree view updates instantly.

### Export Data

Click "Export JSON" to download your entire tab history as a JSON file. Useful for:
- Backing up browsing sessions
- Analyzing browsing patterns
- Transferring data between browsers

### Clear History

Click "Clear History" to delete all tracked tabs. This action cannot be undone. Active tabs will be re-tracked immediately.

### Canvas View & Grouping

The Canvas View provides an infinite 2D workspace where you can spatially organize your tabs.

**Grouping:**

1. **Manual Grouping**
   - Click "‚ûï Create Group" to make a new colored group box
   - Right-click any tab and select "Add to [Group Name]"
   - Groups expand automatically to fit tabs in a 2-column layout
   - Drag groups to move all contained tabs together
   - Delete groups (tabs remain on canvas) or remove tabs from groups

2. **Domain-Based Auto-Grouping**
   - Click "ü§ñ Auto-Group by Domain" in Canvas View
   - Automatically creates groups for sites with 2+ tabs
   - **Preserves manual groups** - only groups ungrouped tabs
   - Example: 10 GitHub tabs, 8 YouTube tabs ‚Üí instant organized groups
   - Groups stack vertically on the left, ungrouped tabs on the right

3. **Clear Auto-Groups**
   - Click "üßπ Clear Auto-Groups" to remove only auto-generated groups
   - Manual groups are preserved
   - Useful for re-organizing after changes

## Customization

### Custom Icons

To create custom icons for the extension:

1. **Option 1: Browser-based (easiest)**
   - Open `generate-icons.html` in your browser
   - Click the download buttons for each icon size
   - Save the icons to the extension folder

2. **Option 2: Node.js script**
   - Install dependencies: `npm install canvas`
   - Run: `node create-icons.js`
   - Icons will be generated automatically

### Modify Styling

Edit `view.css` to customize:
- Colors (root tabs, active/closed badges)
- Spacing and indentation
- Font sizes and styles

## Troubleshooting

### Extension doesn't load
- Make sure Developer mode is enabled in `edge://extensions/`
- Check that all required files are present in the folder
- Look for errors in the Extensions page

### Tabs not being tracked
- Open the Extension page (`edge://extensions/`)
- Click "Service worker" next to the extension to view logs
- Check for JavaScript errors

### Visualization not updating
- Click the "Refresh" button in the visualization
- Check that the background service worker is running
- Reload the visualization tab

### Missing icons
- Icons are required for the extension to load
- Use `generate-icons.html` or `create-icons.js` to create them
- Or replace with your own 16x16, 48x48, and 128x128 PNG files

## Development

This extension uses vanilla JavaScript for simplicity and maintainability. No build process or frameworks required.
