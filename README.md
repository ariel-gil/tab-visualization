# Tab Journey Visualizer

A Microsoft Edge / Chrome extension that visualizes tab relationships and browsing history in an interactive tree view. See how your tabs are connected when opened via hyperlinks or from other tabs.

## Features

- **Tab Relationship Tracking**: Automatically tracks parent-child relationships when tabs are opened
- **Tree Visualization**: View your browsing journey as an interactive hierarchical tree
- **Active/Closed Status**: See which tabs are currently open vs. closed
- **Search & Filter**: Quickly find tabs by title or URL
- **Data Export**: Export your tab history as JSON
- **Persistent Storage**: Tab data survives browser restarts
- **Real-time Updates**: Visualization updates automatically as you browse

## Installation

### Load as Unpacked Extension

1. **Open Edge Extensions Page**
   - Open Microsoft Edge
   - Navigate to `edge://extensions/`
   - Or go to Menu â†’ Extensions â†’ Manage Extensions

2. **Enable Developer Mode**
   - Toggle "Developer mode" ON in the bottom left corner

3. **Load the Extension**
   - Click "Load unpacked"
   - Navigate to the `tab-visualization` folder
   - Click "Select Folder"

4. **Verify Installation**
   - You should see "Tab Journey Visualizer" in your extensions list
   - The extension icon should appear in your toolbar

### Usage

1. **Open the Visualizer**
   - Click the extension icon in your toolbar
   - This will open the visualization in a new tab

2. **Pin the Tab (Recommended)**
   - Right-click on the visualization tab
   - Select "Pin tab"
   - This keeps the visualizer accessible and prevents accidental closing

3. **Browse Normally**
   - Open new tabs by clicking links or using Ctrl+T
   - The extension automatically tracks all tab relationships
   - The visualization updates in real-time

4. **View Your Journey**
   - Root tabs (tabs with no parent) are highlighted in orange
   - Active tabs have a green "ACTIVE" badge
   - Closed tabs have a red "CLOSED" badge and are slightly faded
   - Children are indented under their parent tabs

## Files Overview

### Core Extension Files

- **manifest.json** - Extension configuration (Manifest V3)
- **background.js** - Service worker that tracks tab events
- **view.html** - Main visualization page
- **view.css** - Styling for the visualization
- **view.js** - Logic for rendering the tree and handling interactions
- **icon16.png, icon48.png, icon128.png** - Extension icons

### Helper Files

- **generate-icons.html** - Browser-based tool to create custom icons
- **create-icons.js** - Node.js script to generate icons (optional)

## How It Works

### Background Service Worker (background.js)

The service worker runs in the background and listens for tab events:

- **chrome.tabs.onCreated**: Captures when new tabs are created and stores the parent tab ID (`openerTabId`)
- **chrome.tabs.onUpdated**: Updates tab titles and URLs as pages load
- **chrome.tabs.onRemoved**: Marks tabs as inactive when closed (preserves history)

All data is stored in `chrome.storage.local` which persists across browser sessions.

### Data Structure

Each tab is stored with the following information:

```javascript
{
  id: number,          // Unique tab ID
  title: string,       // Page title
  url: string,         // Page URL
  parentId: number,    // ID of parent tab (or null for root tabs)
  timestamp: number,   // When the tab was created
  active: boolean      // Whether tab is currently open
}
```

### Visualization (view.html/css/js)

The visualization:
1. Loads tab data from `chrome.storage.local`
2. Builds a tree structure by linking children to parents
3. Renders the tree with proper indentation and styling
4. Updates automatically when storage changes

## Features in Detail

### Search & Filter

Type in the search box to filter tabs by title or URL. The tree view updates instantly.

### Export Data

Click "Export JSON" to download your entire tab history as a JSON file. Useful for:
- Backing up browsing sessions
- Analyzing browsing patterns
- Transferring data between browsers

### Clear History

Click "Clear History" to delete all tracked tabs. This action cannot be undone. Active tabs will be re-tracked immediately.

## Customization

### Custom Icons

To create custom icons for the extension:

1. **Option 1: Browser-based (easiest)**
   - Open `generate-icons.html` in your browser
   - Click the download buttons for each icon size
   - Save the icons to the extension folder

2. **Option 2: Node.js script**
   - Install dependencies: `npm install canvas`
   - Run: `node create-icons.js`
   - Icons will be generated automatically

### Modify Styling

Edit `view.css` to customize:
- Colors (root tabs, active/closed badges)
- Spacing and indentation
- Font sizes and styles

## Troubleshooting

### Extension doesn't load
- Make sure Developer mode is enabled in `edge://extensions/`
- Check that all required files are present in the folder
- Look for errors in the Extensions page

### Tabs not being tracked
- Open the Extension page (`edge://extensions/`)
- Click "Service worker" next to the extension to view logs
- Check for JavaScript errors

### Visualization not updating
- Click the "Refresh" button in the visualization
- Check that the background service worker is running
- Reload the visualization tab

### Missing icons
- Icons are required for the extension to load
- Use `generate-icons.html` or `create-icons.js` to create them
- Or replace with your own 16x16, 48x48, and 128x128 PNG files

## Development

This extension uses vanilla JavaScript for simplicity and maintainability. No build process or frameworks required.
